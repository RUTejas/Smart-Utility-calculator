# Smart-Utility-calculator
A beginner-friendly Python project with multiple tools like calculator, unit converter, bitwise operations, variable swap, and more—built using only basic concepts: operators, functions, input, type casting, string concatenation, and simple logic. Great for learning core Python skills.
# Features

The calculator includes the following tools:

Arithmetic Calculator– Perform basic math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
Bitwise Operations – Use bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.
Unit Converter– Convert centimeters to inches.
- Swap Variables – Swap the values of two inputs.
- Round Values – Round a float to the nearest integer.
- Number Properties Checker – Determine if a number is even/odd or positive/negative.
- Identity Checker – Check if two variables refer to the same object.
- Membership Checker – Check if a character exists in a string.
- String Concatenation – Join two input strings.
-  Generator– Dislay a custom welcome message.

# Topics Used

This project is strictly built using:

- Arithmetic, assignment, comparison, bitwise, logical, identity, and membership operators
- Basic data types (int, float, str)
- Input function and type casting
- String concatenation using `+`
- User-defined functions
- Variable swapping
- Round function

No external libraries or advanced concepts are used. This makes the project ideal for early learners.
